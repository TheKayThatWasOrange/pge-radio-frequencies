# PG&E Is An Incompetent, Criminal Organization

You should probably know what they're doing in your neighborhood but Uniden only gives you one frequency to monitor in their factory database. In reality, the village burners use hundreds and hundreds of different frequencies within the following ranges in 12.5KHz steps:

```
451.000000 - 453.012500 MHz
454.018750 - 454.656250 MHz
460.650000 - 462.525000 MHz
463.200000 - 465.012500 MHz
```

While Uniden doesn't support MPT-1327, the hang time on their repeaters is usually long enough that you can easily follow a conversation by just monitoring the analog channels directly. These files make that possible.

Enjoy.
